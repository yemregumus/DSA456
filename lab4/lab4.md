# Lab 4 Reflection and Observations

* name of team member 1
* name of team member 2
* name of team member 3

## Simple sorts

	* which algorithm did you find easiest to understand?
	* which algorithm seemed to fastest for completing the sort?


## Merging Unsorted lists

	* how long did this take
	* did you make any mistakes along the way (did you choose the wrong number and had to move things around)?
		* How many times? 


## Merging Sorted lists

	* how long did this take
	* did you make any mistakes along the way (did you choose the wrong number and had to move things around)?
		* How many times?

## Sorting larger data sets

|Team member | Sorting time|
|---|---|
| Team member 1 |  |
| Team member 2 |  |
| Team member 3 |  |

What was fastest time?


Describe the algorithm produced by the team member with fastest time.


## Partitioning

* how long did it take to partition the data set?


## Sorting the small piles

* how long did it take for you to sort all of the little piles?

## Putting it together

* As a team discuss things that helped soft the papers... what was useful? what was fast to do?  What was slow?
* As a team come up with a description of how best to sort a set of numbers on paper.
* Mix up all your numbers and have each member of the team perform the sort you did.  How long did it take?

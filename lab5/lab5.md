## Heap Insertion

### Picture of heap created with 10 values


### Pictures of adding 11th value to heap


## Heap Removal

### Picture after 1 value was removed from heap



### Picture after 2 value was removed from heap



### Picture after 3 value was removed from heap

### Values removed (in order removed):


## Array representation of heap

### Picture of heap

### Array representation of heap


## Creating a heap from array

### Photograph of your array and heap


* What number is the first non-leaf node starting from bottom?
* What index is that node at?


### Photograph of heap created by Heapify



## HeapSort

Initial questions (do first):
how many values are in your array?
what is index of last value in array?

After doing 1 removal operation

* what was the first value removed? How does this number compare with others in heap (biggest? smallest?)
* Look at your heap portion of the array after you did this removal.. how many values are in it, what is the index of the bottom right most value in heap?

After doing 2 removal operations:

* Perform another remove from the heap and adjust the array to match
* What was the second value removed and how does it compare with others still in heap?
* Look at your heap portion of the array after you did this removal.. how many values are in what is the index of the bottom right most value in heap?
* Are there any open spots in the array that is not part of the heap and not holding anything useful?

After doing 3 removal operations:

* Perform another remove from the heap and adjust the array to match
* What was the second value removed and how does it compare with others still in heap?
* Look at your heap portion of the array after you did this removal.. how many values are in it, what is the index of the bottom right most value in heap?
* Are there any open spots in the array that is not part of the heap and not holding anything useful?


## Reflection

This last part is to be completed individually.

Write a short paragraph about what you learned from this lab.
* Discuss what you learned about heaps and heap sort.
* What was the most surprising thing you learned about heaps?

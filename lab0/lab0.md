# Lab 0

## LaTex Formulas

$C = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ 

$\sum_{i=0}^{n} ar^i$ 

$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \ldots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$

## Reflection here

Latex is a new concept for me and I was not expecting to learn another `langauge` on top of Python, but it is what it is. 

I think CodeSpaces is a convenience, if one can utilize it properly. I am unable to do so at the moment but I am aiming to learn working on github more efficiently.

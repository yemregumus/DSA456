# Reflection for Lab 1
What did you like/not like about Python?

I like Python for few reasons. Python is a easy to read, has a large standart library, a lot of documentation to look and learn, its compatible with most cross platforms, also versatile (web, data science, machine learning, automation etc.). Despite all the things I listed, there is some flaws too. Because Python is interpreted langauge its performance is not comparable to C++ and Java.Python versions are not backward compatible so it might be difficult to transition in between 2 and 3 for legacy codebases. Python also has a reputation on how heavy is its memory usage. Overall I like working with Python no matter what.

Was there anything that behaved differently than you expected in Python?

Whitespace sensitivity is a bit harsh. I`m not used to this and my code seems messy to me. In other langauges we use brackets or keywords to explicitly end scopes or function, this is hard to get used to honestly. Dynamic typing/initiating a variable without declaring it is also weird. 

Based on what you wrote in your lab, write something about the similarities and differences between Python with C/C++ and how that affects how you write your program.

Creating Object`s is similar to C++ but much more simplified. Only have to get used to the syntax. Its nice to see that Python also has input and output operation methods.Although its seems simple in the beginning I think Python is hard to get used to it, as hard as to learn C/C++. Dynamic typing might be beneficial but static typing and its hype to performance in staticly typed langauges is undeniable. 

Thank you for reading my pep talk, I love this course.

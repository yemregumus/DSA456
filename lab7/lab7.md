## Part A: BST Insert

As a group review bst insertion algorithm.

* Take one photo of the original row of sticky notes


* When completed, take one photo of the final tree


Answer this question.

* What is the height of your final tree?


## PART B: BST Deletion

* Find a node in your tree with 2 children and remove that node.
	* Take a picture of tree

* find another node with 2 children and remove that node
	* Take picture of tree

* remove the root node of the tree
	* take picture of tree

Answer this question:

* Anytime you remove a node with 2 children, you need to find a node to take over for node being removed.  Explain how you found your replacement.


## Part C AVL



* Take one photo of the original row of sticky notes

* When completed, take one photo of the final tree

Answer these questions. 
* How many times you had to do a single rotation?
* How many times you had to do a double rotation?
* How tall is your final tree?

## Part D Red-black trees (optional)


* Take one photo of the original row of sticky notes

* When completed, take one photo of the final tree

* how many times did you perform a colour swap, zig-zig and zig-zag rotation?

## Part E 2-3 trees


* Take one photo of the original row of sticky notes

* When completed, take one photo of the final tree

* How many times did you split?

## Part F Dijkstra's Algorithm

Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest distance from vertex A to every other vertex.  Show your work by creating the table below:

| Vertex | Distance to A | Previous Vertex | Known|
|---|---|---|---|
| A  |  0 | -  |  False |


Result summary: Fill in the final result in this table.  For path list all nodes for example, if you are going from A to B to C to D, then path is A-B-C-D


| Vertex | Path | Distance to A|
|---|---|---|
| A  |  - | 0 |

## Part G: Reflection

This last part is to be completed individually.

Write a short paragraph about what you learned from this lab.
